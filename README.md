Hi, this is saintmagnoleon. Also known as Seungyu Jung. I hope I can help people like me to craft their first website to showcase their vision to the world. 
We have to learn from each other, that's the beauty of human nature. Exploit sources, learn to learn and learn to unlearn. Don't be always stuck to a side. Try. And try. And try again. 
And eventually you'll fail. And you'll fail again. But keep going. Failure is going to reduce by its own as long you try. So try. 

Sincerely, 

saintmagnoleon, aka Seungyu Jung
